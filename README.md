<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of this proyect was to do something I used on my daily basis and that is useful. This project have and habits page that allows you to create and manage all the tasks you have and a timer to track how productive you are while doing the tasks.
<br />
<br />
### What did I used to get the best of this project?

  * Learn how to work with reusable components in React.
  * Use contexts to manage states and data inside the app.
  * Learn how to work with tricky functions like setTimeout to make the Timer working.

### What interesting components can I find?
    
   * PRO Timer, to keep track of the time while you work on the computer.
   * Habits page, where you can manage your own habits.

<br />

## Posible extra features and improvements

Some features I would like to add are:

 * Calendar page where all the habits are displayed.
 * Login with some auth and account.
 * Save the data in a database and not in localStorage.
